    course: 'Math Competitions 1 student',
    testimonial: `The commitment to learning and excellence all for free really stood out. 
        Normally, you would assume people to charge large swaths of money for content 
        of this standard and genre, but the level at which content was presented and 
        the follow-up and help to students was phenomenal and at the same time was 
        free of cost.`

    testimonial: `Everaise is the same quality of a paid program. It is very 
        organized, and I had lots of fun. I learned more in this one month than I 
        probably did in a year. I would really push you to consider it, the value 
        for your money is, quite literally, infinite! 10^10^10/10 would recommend.`
