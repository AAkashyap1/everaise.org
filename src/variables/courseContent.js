export const whyEveraise = `Our goal at Everaise is to instill a lifelong 
love of learning in our students. We aren’t just a contest preparation bootcamp — 
although our program is excellent raining for academic competitions, our real 
objective is to expose kids to cool and interesting material they might never have 
seen before. To that end, we offer students comprehensive, in-depth opportunities 
to learn new subjects — and come to love them, too.\n\nIn our courses, we emphasize 
building deeper understanding over memorizing techniques and formulas. We provide 
plenty of detailed examples in each handout, with each solution properly motivated 
and explained; our office hour sessions are run by some of the most talented high 
school and college students in their respective subject areas.\n\nWe believe that 
knowledge should be equally accessible to students of all backgrounds, which is why 
our courses will always be free for everyone`

export const courseFormat = `Throughout our Summer 2021 courses, students will work 
through handouts and watch videos that will develop theory, provide examples to 
cultivate a true understanding of the material, and provide challenging problems to 
be submitted for homework. Each set of handouts and videos is expected to take 
roughly 4-5 hours per topic, so students who wish to gain a deep understanding of 
the material should expect to spend about 12-15 hours per week.\n\nOur web portal, 
Everaise Launch, is up and running! There, students will be able to register for 
classes and view the corresponding handouts, videos, and homework submission forms 
when the courses begin. All Summer 2021 courses are self-paced with recommended 
(optional) due dates; students are free to jump around between the accessible materials.
More details about Everaise Launch and registration will be posted shortly.\n\n
Instructors will be available via Discord, both for general communication on our 
discussion board and for office hours that will run several times per week. Students 
will also be able to chat with each other on Discord. Students who do not have access 
to Discord will only be able to contact instructors via email, where response times 
will be much slower.`
