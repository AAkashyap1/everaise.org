const whyEveraise = `Our goal at Everaise is to instill a lifelong 
love of learning in our students. We aren’t just a contest preparation bootcamp — 
although our program is excellent raining for academic competitions, our real 
objective is to expose kids to cool and interesting material they might never have 
seen before. To that end, we offer students comprehensive, in-depth opportunities 
to learn new subjects — and come to love them, too.\n\nIn our courses, we emphasize 
building deeper understanding over memorizing techniques and formulas. We provide 
plenty of detailed examples in each handout, with each solution properly motivated 
and explained; our office hour sessions are run by some of the most talented high 
school and college students in their respective subject areas.\n\nWe believe that 
knowledge should be equally accessible to students of all backgrounds, which is why 
our courses will always be free for everyone`
