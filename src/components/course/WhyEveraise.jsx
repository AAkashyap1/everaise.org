      Our goal at Everaise is to instill a lifelong love of learning in our students. We aren’t just a
      contest preparation bootcamp — although our program is excellent training for academic competitions,
      our real objective is to expose kids to cool and interesting material they might never have seen before.
      To that end, we offer students comprehensive, in-depth opportunities to learn new subjects — and
      come to love them, too.

      <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-500">
        In our courses, we emphasize building deeper understanding over memorizing techniques and formulas. We
        provide plenty of detailed examples in each handout, with each solution properly motivated and explained;
        our office hour sessions are run by some of the most talented high school and college students in their
        respective subject areas.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-gray-500">
        We believe that knowledge should be equally accessible to students of all backgrounds, which is why our
        courses will always be free for everyone.
