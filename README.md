# Everaise Launch
Everaise Launch is the learning management system for the Everaise Academy summer program. Students of the program can manage homework submissions, grades, and course enrollments through this all-in-one platform, while program coordinators and administrators have access to an administration portal which allows them to create assignments and announcements. You can view the site at https://launch.everaise.org. There are almost 1000 students who have used this platform to advance their STEM skills in the past three months.
